# TodoGenie Project Context

## Overview
TodoGenie is an enterprise-grade, voice-controlled todo application that leverages modern web technologies and artificial intelligence to provide an intuitive task management experience. The application combines voice commands with AI processing to enable natural interaction with todo items.

## Architecture & Best Practices

### Voice Control System
The voice control system follows a clean, modular architecture:

1. **Voice Recognition (`src/lib/voice/recognition.ts`)**
   - Implements Browser Web Speech API with proper TypeScript types
   - Uses EventEmitter pattern for loose coupling
   - Handles browser compatibility (standard + webkit)
   - Properly typed event handlers and state management

2. **Command Parser (`src/lib/voice/commandParser.ts`)**
   - Pure function approach for command parsing
   - Strong typing with discriminated unions
   - Extensible command pattern design

3. **Text-to-Speech (`src/lib/voice/speak.ts`)**
   - ElevenLabs API integration
   - Environment-based configuration
   - Promise-based audio playback

4. **UI Components**
   - `VoiceStatus`: Real-time feedback component
   - `VoiceRecorder`: Recording state management
   - Follows React best practices (hooks, effects)

### Code Quality & Testing

#### Type Safety
- Comprehensive TypeScript types for all components
- Global type declarations for Web Speech API
- Strict null checks and type assertions

#### Testability
1. **Unit Testing**
   - Pure functions in commandParser are easily testable
   - Mocked Web Speech API for recognition tests
   - Isolated ElevenLabs API calls

2. **Component Testing**
   - VoiceStatus component accepts mock handlers
   - Event emitter pattern enables test observation
   - Separated concerns for UI and logic

3. **Integration Testing**
   - End-to-end voice command flow
   - MongoDB operation verification
   - API response handling

#### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation for unsupported browsers
- Clear error messages for API failures
- State recovery mechanisms

### State Management & Operations

#### Todo Operations Dispatcher
The application implements a robust dispatcher pattern for todo operations:

1. **Custom Hook (`src/lib/hooks/useTodoDispatcher.ts`)**
   - Centralized operation handling
   - Type-safe action dispatching
   - Memoized callbacks for performance
   - Comprehensive error handling

2. **Supported Operations**
   - Create: Add new todos
   - Read: Retrieve todo information
   - Update: Modify existing todos
   - Delete: Remove todos
   - Complete: Mark todos as done
   - Search: Filter todos by query

3. **Implementation Benefits**
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Improved testability
   - Type-safe operations
   - Centralized error handling
   - Performance optimized
   - Easy to extend

4. **Testing Strategy**
   - Unit tests for each operation
   - Mock handler verification
   - Error case coverage
   - Integration with React components
